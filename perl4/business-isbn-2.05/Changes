Revision history for Perl extension Business::ISBN.

2.05 - Sun Jan 25 00:00:17 2009
	* Updated for latest data in Business::ISBN::Data

2.04_01 - Mon Oct 27 12:08:03 2008
	* Revert the GD prereq. A lot of testers have borked GD 
	installs.
	* Require 5.8. Some of the new stuff isn't playing well with
	5.6

2.04 - Sun Oct 26 18:29:20 2008
	* Fix tests that used 99902 as a bad prefix. That now 
	belongs to Gabon.

2.03 - Sat Oct 27 02:48:15 2007
	* adjustments to make png_barcode.t actually work (RT #30291)

2.03 - Tue Oct  2 03:17:34 2007
	* Fixed minor distro problems and bumped to release version 2.03

2.02_05 - Wed Sep 12 13:27:09 2007
	* Explore RT #29292. I don't seem to have the problem with
	hyphens for ISBN-13, but let's see what CPAN Testers has to
	say

2.02_04 - Sat Sep  1 14:55:00 2007
	[BUGFIX] ISBN13 was returning "Bookland" for all groups, but 
	it shouldn't do that. Now it returns the same thing you'd
	get from ISBN10 (e.g. "English", "German", ... ).

2.02_03 - Sat Sep  1 04:12:49 2007
	[BUGFIX] RT 29089 - I had the wrong _max_length for ISBN13. That 13
	is the hint that it should be 13. :)

2.02_02 - Sat Aug 25 05:57:22 2007
	[FEATURE] added exportable function valid_isbn_checksum that 
	takes care of all of the object stuff for you and just gives
	you the answer. In previous docs, this was called is_valid_checksum
	even though that conflicted with an object method. It was
	documented but never implemented. Now it's there. :)
	[BUGFIX] now should pass tests under 5.6.2, after a bit of
	backporting. Upgrade already people! :)

2.02_01 - Fri Aug 17 14:00:51 2007
	* Don't import import() from Exporter. There are a lot of people
	(apparently) using very old perls, not just CPAN Testers.

2.02 - Wed Aug 15 03:11:25 2007
	* fixes RT #28843: an ISBN-13 with a bad prefix shouldn't croak,
	but return an object that explains the error.

2.01 - Sun Aug 12 22:28:01 2007
	* Official release of Business::ISBN to handle ISBN-13
	* Does not handle 979- numbers yet (need publisher data for that)
	* Does handle 978-numbers, which is the 10 digit ISBN with a 
	different "country code", so it uses the same publisher data
	* There are significant API changes to handle the new stuff. It's
	not so bad, but test it before you rip out the old Business::ISBN
	stuff.

2.00_01 - Wed Mar 14 00:38:18 2007
	* DEVELOPER RELEASE
	* Completely redone internals to handle ISBN-10 and ISBN-13
	* Some interface changes to Business::ISBN 1.x
	* Removed exportable functions.

1.84 - Tue Jan  9 23:10:00 2007
	* updated copyright and license info
	* no code changes, so no need to upgrade

1.82 - Sun Aug 14 11:42:18 2005
	* fixed up publisher code validation, since 0 can be a valid
	code. I hadn't run into one of those before, and now I know
	I wasn't doing that right.
	* This is an important code change. Everyone should upgrade.

1.81 - Sat Aug 13 22:08:40 2005
	* exposed the country group name as the country() method

1.80 - Tue Mar  8 16:58:47 2005
	* added POD coverage tests and documented the uncovered methods
	it found

1.79 - Tue Dec 14 05:00:37 2004
	* Updated tests for new ISBN data: previously invalid ISBNs are now
	valid.  The latest data is in Business::ISBN::Data 1.09 and is current
	as of November 2004.
	* You don't need this version of Business::ISBN if you already have it,
	although you should get the latest Business::ISBN::Data.

1.78 - Sun Nov 21 19:46:40 2004
	* Require the latest version on Business::ISBN::Data, which was
	unbundled in the last version.  You need Business::ISBN::Data 1.08
	to pass the latest tests that check for the new ranges the ISBN
	folks assigned a couple of years ago.

1.77 - Wed Oct 27 02:39:17 2004
	* removed Business::ISBN::Data, which is now a separate module so
	you can update the data without updating the rest of the stuff. 
	Previously, CPAN.pm would install Business::ISBN::Data as a
	prerequisite, and this distribution would come along and overwrite
	it with old data.  That was a bad thing.

1.76 - Fri Oct  8 16:12:51 2004
	* somehow this module went missing from CPAN, so here it is again
	* no need to upgrade if you have the previous version

1.74 - Thu Sep  2 17:17:20 2004
	* another distro fix: some documentation cleanups, and the README
	is now in MANIFEST.  You do not need to upgrade if you already
	have installed this module.

1.73 - Thu Sep  2 16:21:10 2004
	* this is a distro fix only.  if you already have Business::ISBN,
	you don't need this

1.72 - Wed Feb 11 16:18:30 2004
	* removed errant File::Find::Rule use
	* Check for modules in png_barcode before require-ing them

1.71 - Wed Jan 28 13:00:38 2004
	* added xISBN support
	* removed File::Find::Rule, Test::Pod, Test::Prereq dependencies

1.69	Thu Sep  5 01:18:26 CDT 2002
	- documentation fixes - that's it
	
1.68	Wed Sep  4 15:51:29 CDT 2002
	- converted to Test::More
	- fixed ean_to_isbn to handle new EAN prefix 979

1.60	Sun Apr  1 17:06:28 EDT 2001
	- fixed some POD problems
	- no changes to the actual code

1.59	Tue Mar 27 11:51:42 EST 2001
	- fixed some -w dirty internals
	- clarified documentation for as_string method

1.58	Mon Mar 26 19:47:03 EST 2001
	- there was an error in test.pl that failed to
	identify a bug. Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>
	found it though.  the constructor was always
	setting $obj->is_valid to BAD_CHECKSUM.  that
	is fixed.
	- version 1.57 should not be used at all.  it
	is severely broken due to that bug.

1.57	Wed Mar 21 18:07:17 EST 2001
	- fixed -w dirty line in is_valid_checksum
	(identified by Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>)

1.56	  Mon Mar 12 10:03:37 EST 2001
	EVERYONE SHOULD UPGRADE TO THIS VERSION
	- fixed problem parsing ISBNs without valid
	country codes which would cause an infinite
	loop. (identified by Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>)
	- this module is now kept in a local CVS repository
	- added symbolic constants to replace magic return
	values.  see the docs for details.
	- fixed is_valid_checksum which would issue warnings
	if the string was less than ten characters
	(identified by Adam Thompson <athompso@athompso.net>)
	- added a test.pl which still needs more tests to
	reach all of the code.

1.51      Wed Jan 24 14:22:02 EST 2001
	- version 1.5 fixed some bugs with checksums
	- version 1.51 has a few minor doc fixes
	- now we have sane version numbers. :)

20001010  Sat Sep  9 00:33:07 EDT 2000
	- fixed some missing arguments to _is_valid.  
	- updated contact information
	- added some real tests to test.pl
	- everyone should update their installations

19990112  Mon Jan 11 18:03:07 EST 1999
	- added "use Exporter" which was missing.  

19980901  Tue Sep 01 15:15:30 1998
	- added support for EAN-13 (isbn -> ean, ean -> isbn )
	- cleaned up other nagging problems
	- if you don't want EAN13, then you don't need this update

19980329  Sun Mar 29 03:29:16 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
	- gutsy enough to actually release it for testing and comments

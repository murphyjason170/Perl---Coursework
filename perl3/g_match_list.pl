$_ = join ' ', split /\n/, <<'END_OF_TEXT';

This text is embedded in the program in multiple
lines, but our program splits the heredoc into
a list of lines (which don't contain the newline
characters themselves, because those were what was
split on), and then joins them with single spaces
to form a single long string.  All in one expression, too!
END_OF_TEXT

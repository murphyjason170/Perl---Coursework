Today I visited http://www.oreillyschool.com/ and logged in to
my courses, then I hopped over to http://www.cnn.com/ for some general news,
and http://www.perlbuzz.com/ for the latest cool news about Perl.
Then I tried the address http://xyz.liklkvsj.xx/ that someone I didn't
know emailed me about, but I couldn't reach it.
